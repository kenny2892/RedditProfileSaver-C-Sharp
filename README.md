# Reddit - Profile Saver - C# Website Edition

This is a C# Asp.Net Core website that I made to help me keep a list of posts I upvote on Reddit.com and allow me to filter and view them. The reason for this is because Reddit only allows you to view the most recent 1000 posts you have upvoted and doesn't allow for any searching system. This allows you to store as many posts as you want in a Json and Sqlite file that can be parsed and viewed by the website. I made this as a continuation of my [Java App](https://github.com/kenny2892/RedditProfileSaver-Java). This is because of various reasons that can be found on the projects page.

<ins>**This project is designed to be run on my local network, so security and efficency are not a priority.**</ins>

The website has various features:
- Standard CRUD for each post
- Infinite scrolling
- Auto scrolling
- Lots of search configuration settings
- Seeded randomization of posts
- Ability to mark posts to be hidden
- Ability to view post content hosted on many different sites such as Twitter, Youtube, Gfycat, Imgur, etc.

There are two parts to the program:
1. The Python Retrieval Script
2. The C# Asp.Net Core website

To setup both parts, you must configure some of their settings:

To run the Python script that gets your upvotes, you must register a bot with the Reddit Api and get a refresh token for your account. Then you can enter the appropriate information into the Config.json within the Data folder. This will allow the Python script to run and store the 1000 most recent upvoted posts for your account.

To run the website, you must enter in these strings within the appsettings and appsettings.Development:
1. DefaultConnection: This is where you want the Posts Database to be located. Should look something like: "Data Source=C:\\Users\\Name\\Documents\\Databases\\RedditPosts.db"
2. SubredditIconConnection: This is where you want the Subreddit Icons Database to be located. Should look something like: "Data Source=C:\\Users\\Name\\Documents\\Databases\\SubredditIcons.db"
3. PythonScriptDirectory: This is the directory where you placed the Python script. Should look something like: "C:\\Users\\Name\\Documents\\Databases"
4. PostsJson: This is the Json file containing all the Upvotes. It is generated by the Python script so it should be found in the above folder. Should look something like: "C:\\Users\\Name\\Documents\\Databases\\YourUsername - Upvoted.json"
5. PythonExe: The location of your Python executable. Should look something like: "C:\\Python\\Python39\\python.exe"
6. Password: What you want the password for the website to be. Should look something like: "TestPassword"

Once the website is started (through something like IIS or Azure) you can launch the Python script from the home page.
